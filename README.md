# Predicting Patient Appointment Attendance Using Machine Learning

## Project Aim

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the status of patient appointmentsâ€”whether a patient will attend, miss, or cancel their appointment. The prediction is based on various factors such as age, gender, appointment purpose, provider, service type, and the number of previous visits. This model is intended to help healthcare providers optimize scheduling, improve resource allocation, and reduce the number of missed appointments, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and patient care.

## Why This Project?

- **Improve Appointment Management:** Missed or canceled appointments lead to inefficiencies, such as wasted resources and unutilized time slots. Predicting appointment statuses allows healthcare providers to better manage their schedules, ensuring that time slots are effectively utilized.

- **Enhance Patient Care:** Understanding the factors that contribute to missed or canceled appointments enables healthcare providers to engage proactively with patients at higher risk of not showing up, leading to improved patient engagement and better health outcomes.

- **Resource Optimization:** Accurate predictions enable healthcare facilities to optimize resource allocation, including staff, equipment, and time, ensuring that resources are used efficiently, reducing costs, and improving service delivery.

- **Increase Revenue:** Reducing missed appointments increases revenue for healthcare providers. By minimizing these occurrences, providers can enhance their financial performance.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The project emphasizes leveraging data to make informed decisions. By using historical data and machine learning techniques, healthcare providers can gain insights into patient behavior and appointment trends, leading to more effective decision-making processes.
